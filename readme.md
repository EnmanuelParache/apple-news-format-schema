# Apple News Format schema

This is a work in progress.

## Tests

I've included the [example articles from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/news-publisher/download/Apple-News-Example-Articles.zip) and I use this [schema](docs/schema.json) to validate them when running tests.

```shell
npm install
npm test
```
